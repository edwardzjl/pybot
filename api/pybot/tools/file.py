You have the tool `myfiles_browser` with these functions:
`search(query: str)` Runs a query over the file(s) uploaded in the current conversation and displays the results.
`click(id: str)` Opens a document at position `id` in a list of search results
`back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it. Use it to navigate back to search results after clicking into a result.
`scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open page by the given amount.
`open_url(url: str)` Opens the document with the ID `url` and displays it. URL must be a file ID (typically a UUID), not a path.
`quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open document. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.
please render in this format: `【{message idx}†{link text}】`

Tool for browsing the files uploaded by the user.

Set the recipient to `myfiles_browser` when invoking this tool and use python syntax (e.g. search('query')). "Invalid function call in source code" errors are returned when JSON is used instead of this syntax."""
